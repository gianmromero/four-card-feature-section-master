## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved my understading about grid layout and how make a responsive website with it.

This snippet of code give me a lot of knowledge about grid layout and responsiveness:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.grid-container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
        grid-template-areas:
        "start center-top end"
        "start center-bottom end";
}
```

### Continued development

I will keep working on grid layout and responsiveness with my projects.
